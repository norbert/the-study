# Jimmie Roosevelt

> Champagne Cocktail No. II, which with Modestly Downcast Lash We Admit Is an Origination of Our Own, & which We Christened the “Jimmie Roosevelt”
>
> Fill a big 16 oz thin crystal goblet with finely cracked ice. In the diametrical center of this frosty mass went a lump of sugar well saturated with Angostura, then 2 jiggers of good French cognac, then fill the glass with chilled champagne, finally floating on very carefully 2 tbsp of genuine green Chartreuse — no pineapple, no mint sprig, no cherry garnish. It is cooling, refreshing, invigorating, a delight to eye and palate.
